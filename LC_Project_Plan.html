<h1>This is what went into my planning process</h1>
<p>
    When I began my brainstorming process, I was initially drawn to something that could link well-being and studying. I know from personal experience and stories from peers that study can be a major stress 
    inducer for students. I want to take advantage of the micrbobit's versatility. I want to be able to utilize its ability to pick up sound levels and find a way to manipulate its features into making a clock. 
    The buttons on the micrbobit will also be of great use to me as I can make the user press these buttons when required. My plan is to take in the study location from the user and from there on the study session
     is to begin. If their studying environment surpasses the set sound threshold, at the end of each minute a beep will be made alerting the student that that minute was ineffective encouraging them to seek a new 
     place to study. On the other hand, if it was an effective minute no sound will be made so as not to disturb the student. Once their study session has been completed, they will be required to click a button on 
     the microbit so that the data from that session can be logged. From there, it will be sent to the firebase, taken in by another code file to be interpreted and displayed to fulfill my basic and advanced 
     requirements. I also plan to have comments throughout the code so that its easy to follow in the case that i have to take time away from the project
