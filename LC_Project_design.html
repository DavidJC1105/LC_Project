<h1>Here is what went into my designing process</h1>
<p>
    This project will consist of 6 main parts, User input, a data logging system, a data analysis system, a prediction model, interpretation functions and graphing functions: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The user will use the microbit and will have the data logged to firebase so that my model can use the info from each session to interpret it </li>
    <li>A dataset will be added to the firebase so that there is data that can be interpreted in order to give the user an idea of how it is all laid out and their own personal study session data will be 
        interpreted in unison with this dataset to show how they compared to the example data </li>
    <li>All the data at the given time will be analyzed and interpreted in both words and visually as to give the user the best chance of understanding the data </li>
    <li>Depending on the information the user wishes to see a prediction will be made in text within the data they are presented with </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I will meet some of the universal design features by trying to encorporate principals 1 and 7
