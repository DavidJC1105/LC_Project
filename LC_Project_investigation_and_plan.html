<h1>This is what went into my investigation</h1>
<p>
    I started my research by looking into well-being and studying style apps. While investigating these apps I found that while researching in the classroom it was too loud to get valuable study and research in. 
    This is where I came up with the idea to have a system that would help me to find a better place to study. With my system I will take advantage of the microphone on the microbit. As a student with a busy 
    lifestyle on top of school I know how hard it can be to find a good place to get effective study in. It is commonly known that loud environments can hinder your ability to read and get effective study in. 
    Within my website you will be able to find an assessment of your choice of study location based on noise. It will show you if your quietest environment was in a domestic setting or a public setting and will
     use this information to recommend where you should continue your study time to optimize the effectiveness of the study time that you have. All this information will be assessed through a firebase. This system 
     should ultimately improve your well-being through reducing stress by getting effective study in the best environment for you 
</p>
<h1>This is how my system will meet the requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Having an automated system that will track an analogue input (sound) and a digital input (Starting and stopping study time) </li>
    <li>The code will record the data inputs by the user and the microbit to a firebase </li>
    <li>The code will assess the information provided and will give recommendations to optimize study sessions</li>
    <li>The system should benefit your well-being by helping you get effective study reducing stress from a school or work life </li>
</ul>
<h1>What if 1:</h1>
<h4>What if a student wishes to know the least stressful environments based on previous sessions?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>My model will visually show you where the best study sessions took place and the relative date, time spent studying and your wasted time  </li>
</ul>
<h1>What if 2:</h1>
<h4>What if a student wishes to know how many times their worst study location surpassed the noise threshold for effective studying based on previous sessions? </h4>
<ul>
    <li>My model will visually show what time your worst session(s) were and where they took place and what percentage of that session was wasted </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>My code will be able to assess your environment and using that information tell you if it was a good study space or somewhere you should try to avoid </h4>
<ul>
    <li>My what if questions will use 3 parameters being tracking time (float), checking the sound levels of the environment (string) and check location(string) and my code will take this information and 
        reiterate it back to the user in a simple and coherent manner </li>
    <li>My model will graphically display to the user the amount of time they spent studying and how much of that time was wasted </li>
</ul>
