<h1>This is my Evaluation</h1>
<p>I am very proud of the project I was able to produce. I created an embedded system that will perform the calculations the user requests. It takes in sound as an anologue input and button pressed as an digital input. 
    It produces a sound as an output. Each time it makes a sound it means a minute has been wasted. The data is validated and stored to a firebase using a loop. As the user requests some data, my model will make some 
    calculations. Using these calculations it will give a prediction of where you should study and at what time and it will be backed up by the best session that had been done to date in order to reduce stress levels.
    Using data from the microbit and a dataset that I created myself, I was able to fulfill my what ifs. Each what if question has its own function. Each functions takes in 3 inputs of time, time wasted and total time 
    spent. Once this is done and some smaller calculations are made, the data is sent to be graphed and the relevant graph to what the user requested to see will be displayed. My first what if is asking what if
    the user wants to know information about their best session they have done to date. If the input the relevant input for this information they will be met with some text showing their best session,
    a prediction and a graph. My second what uf asks what if the user wishes to know information about their worst session. If they request this information, my model will search the firebase to find this as it does for
    for the best sessions. Once it find the worst session the user will be met with some information like where it was, what percentage of time was wasted etc. Once they have been presesnted with this information
    a prediction will be made and a graph will be shown also. The user can also see all their sessions and the relevant graph if they wish. I think this concept could be improved
    by using a more dedicated device that has a better microphone, dedicated storage for more mobility and ease of for the device and a better system to track time. With the right resources I Believe this has a 
    lot of potential for this concept. If completed to its full potential I believe it could help a lot of students with their studies and could life their lives with less stress due to exams.
