<div class="block-caps_2">Brief Project Overview</div>
<p>My project is based around getting effective study done. between my dataset and the data that the user provides using the microbits, my model will take in all this information and interpret it in a way that 
    is easy to read for the user. It can show you what you best session(s) were and it will be presesnted to the user visually and in words. The same can be done for the worst sessions. if the user just wishes to see 
    all the sessions, they will be met with all the sessions printed chronologically, which will be then followed by a graph. The graph will also show the total averages for all the sessions combined. All these inputs 
    can be accessed depending on what the user wishes to see. They will be prompted and will have to input whatever information it is they want to see. This is done so that they arent given information that they didn't 
    want, meaning they dont have to filter through everything themselves.
